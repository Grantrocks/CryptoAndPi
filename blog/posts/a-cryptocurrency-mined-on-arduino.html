      <p>Yes you read the title right. There is a cryptocurrency that can be mined with a arduino. This cryptocurrency is called Duino Coin or DUCO. Its a somewhat new cryptocurrency that operates on the ERC-20 chain. Its very easy to mine and I will tell you how to do that.</p>
      <h3 class="header-3">A Little Info</h3>
      <p>The cryptocurrency duino coin was designed so that there would be low electricity costs and be eco friendly. Its very simple and easy to use. All you have to do is go to the website <a href="https://duinocoin.com" target="_blank">duinocoin.com</a> and click web wallet or get started make a wallet and then follow the next steps.</p>
      <h3 class="header-3">Mining Duino Coin</h3>
      <p>If you want to mine duino coin you should not mine it with high end hardware. You want to mine it with low end hardware such as the arduino uno or raspberry pi pico. The reason for this is duino coin aims to be a eco-friendly cryptocurrency so they reward you with less crypto than you would get mining with a 5 dollar computer so that you dont use as much energy mining with a expensive pc. This is truly a great thing to do and you should give duino coin a look. The steps to mining duino coin are fairly simple. Download their repo which you can <a href="https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/archive/refs/heads/master.zip">do right here</a>. Then install arduino which I will have a article on my site for and setup your arduino with the program. Once your arduino has the mining program installed launch the avr miner program and watch yourself mine duino coin on a small board that uses pretty much no electricity. And if you want to take this even further you can setup a standalone mining rig which can be found in their getting started page.</p>
      <p>Mining on a raspberry pi? The setup is simple. Use the following commands and they will install everything for you.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>cd</li>
        <li>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Grantrocks/duino-coin/master/Tools/duco-install-rpi.sh</li>
        <li>sudo chmod a+x duco-install-rpi.sh</li>
        <li>./duco-install-rpi.sh</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Thats it you should now be ready to go and mine duino coin whenever you want. Make sure to update the code to every now and then by going to the Duino Coin folder and typing <strong>git pull</strong>.</p>

It was created so that people could learn more about the digital world while they were stuck at their homes learning new hobbies. We also made the site to help people sort out the real crypto faucets from the fake ones so that you dont have to research about them and you can just sign up.</p>
