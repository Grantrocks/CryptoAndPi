      <p>This site was originally created in 2020 due to the covid 19 outbreak. It was created so that people could learn more about the digital world while they were stuck at their homes learning new hobbies. We also made the site to help people sort out the real crypto faucets from the fake ones so that you dont have to research about them and you can just sign up.</p>
